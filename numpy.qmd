## Introduction
Python has not been designed with number crunching in mind. In fact, if you try to use lists for numeric computing, you will soon notice several caveats:

-   Operations with lists are slow
-   Lists do not store numeric data efficiently
-   Performing elementwise operations is cumbersome

Consider the following example, a list `x` containing numbers from 1 to 10:

```{python}
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Let's try to add 1 to each element in the list. Intuitively, we might try this as follows:

```{python}
#| eval: false
x + 1  # error
```
```
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list
```

Apparently, this results in an error. The `+` operator concatenates two lists or adds two integers, but it does not know what to do with a list and an integer. We could use a list comprehension to perform the calculation:

```{python}
[e + 1 for e in x]
```

Although this works, it is quite a lot to type for such a (seemingly) simple operation. Using the built-in `map()` function does not make things simpler either:

```{python}
list(map(lambda x: x + 1, x))
```

In summary, these examples show that because lists are general-purpose containers, they are not suitable for numeric computations. List operations are also pretty slow when compared to numeric arrays in other programming languages (such as C, Fortran, or Julia). Finally, lists use a lot of memory compared to numeric arrays in other languages.

Even though the `array` module in the standard library features an `array` data type (which stores elements of the same type much more efficiently than lists), elementwise operations with a simple syntax are still not supported.

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) solves all of these issues. The importance of this third-party package cannot be understated: without NumPy, Python would not be one of the most popular programming language for data science. Many scientific packages like SciPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn rely on NumPy under the hood, so it makes sense to learn the basics even if you do not plan to work with NumPy directly. This is the goal of this chapter.

## The n-dimensional array
Before we discuss NumPy in detail, here is how you can use it in our previous example:

```{python}
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
x + 1
```

Voilà! We added 1 to each element in the array by just typing `x + 1` -- no list comprehensions, lambda functions, or other gymnastics necessary.

Of course, we need to import NumPy before we can use it. By convention, this is done by `import numpy as np`.

The core of NumPy is the n-dimensional homogeneous array (or short ndarray or just array). This data type is a highly efficient container for homogeneous data, which means that all elements must be of the same type (typically, elements are numeric types such as integers or floats). The data is also structured into dimensions (also called axes), so an array can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and so on (n-dimensional in general).

Let's take a look at our array `x` that we have just created:

```{python}
type(x)
```

Alright, so this is an object of type `numpy.ndarray` -- a NumPy array!

Each object of type `numpy.ndarray` (short ndarray) has a `dtype` attribute, which contains the type of its elements. In our example, all elements are integers (represented by 64 bits):

```{python}
x.dtype
```

Our array looks like a list, so it should have only one dimension. The `shape` attribute contains the shape of the array:

```{python}
x.shape
```

Indeed, `x` has one dimension containing 10 elements.

In addition to `dtype` and `shape`, the following attributes are also available:

-   `ndim` contains the number of dimensions (axes) (this is equal to the length of the `shape` tuple)
-   `size` contains the total number of elements in the array (this is equal to the product of the individual `shape` elements)
-   `itemsize` contains the size of one element in bytes (this is normally apparent from the `dtype`, for example `np.float64` means that one element occupies 64 bits, which corresponds to 8 bytes)

These are the attributes for our example array `x`:

```{python}
x.ndim
x.size
x.itemsize
```

## Creating arrays
### From existing sequences
The `np.array()` function takes a sequence (such as a list) and produces a NumPy array. We already saw how this function generates a one-dimensional array:

```{python}
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
x
```

If we pass a list of lists, we can create a two-dimensional array:

```{python}
y = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]])
y
```

This array consists of five rows and two columns, as can be verified by inspecting its shape:

```{python}
y.shape
```

In other words, the first dimension contains five elements, and the second dimension contains two elements. In any n-dimensional array, the last dimension can be interpreted as columns, and the second last dimension corresponds to rows. More deeply nested lists are mapped to additional dimensions, so here's how to create a three-dimensional array:

```{python}
z = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])
z
```

The shape of `z` is:

```{python}
z.shape
```

This can be interpreted as two tables with two rows and three columns each (remember that the last two dimensions correspond to rows and columns).

All of the arrays that we created so far contain integers (because our lists that we provided to initialize the arrays also contained integers):

```{python}
x.dtype, y.dtype, z.dtype
```

We can also create arrays consisting of floating point numbers, for example:

```{python}
f = np.array([[1.1, 5.2, -8.3], [-4.4, 15.5, 9.6]])
f.dtype
```

We can even specify the desired data type:

```{python}
g = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=float)
g
```

Notice the decimal points in the output; the data type is therefore:

```{python}
g.dtype
```

:::{.callout-info}
Besides the standard Python data types `int` and `float`, more specific types with a fixed size are available as `np.int32`, `np.int64`, `np.uint32`, `np.uint64`, `np.float32`, `np.float64`, and so on. In fact, on most platforms `int` and `float` map to `np.int64` and `np.float64`, respectively. See the documentation for [array scalars](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html) for more details.
:::

### Number ranges
The `np.arange()` function creates an array with equally-spaced numbers:

```{python}
np.arange(10)
```

The function accepts custom values for the start, end, and step size of the sequence:

```{python}
np.arange(start=3, stop=11, step=0.8)
```

If you need a specific number of equally-spaced values within a given range, `np.linspace()` and `np.logspace()` are useful. For example, the following command creates an array with eight values between 13 and 14:

```{python}
np.linspace(start=13, stop=14, num=8)
```

The `np.linspace()` and `np.logspace()` functions can be helpful when you want to evaluate a function at many points. The following example plots a complete period of a sine using 100 equally-spaced points:

```{python}
#| eval: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)  # 100 values from 0 to 2𝜋
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| classes: dark-mode
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
plt.style.use("dark_background")
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, np.sin(x))
fig.patch.set_alpha(0)
plt.show()
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| classes: light-mode
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
plt.style.use("default")
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, np.sin(x))
fig.patch.set_alpha(0)
plt.show()
```

Note that we use [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to plot the sine function values for these 100 points with a line graph, but don't worry too much about the plot right now. We will discuss Matplotlib in more detail later.

Next, let's create a logarithmically-spaced array with 16 numbers ranging from 10^-1^ to 10^7^:

```{python}
np.logspace(start=-1, stop=7, num=16)
```

### Filled arrays
Sometimes, it is necessary to create an array consisting of all zeros, ones, or any arbitrary fixed value. This can be achieved with `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, and `np.full()`. If you only want to pre-allocate an array of a given size and do not care which values it contains initially, you can use `np.empty()`.

```{python}
np.zeros((2, 3))  # 2 rows, 3 columns
```

The default data type is `np.float64` (a floating point number with 64 bits, also known as double), but you can specify the desired type with the `dtype` argument:

```{python}
np.zeros((2, 3), dtype=np.int64)
```

Creating an array with all ones works similarly:

```{python}
np.ones((3, 3))
```

Next, we create an array filled with `61`:

```{python}
np.full((2, 2), 61)
```

We can also just allocate an array if we do not care about its initial values (which is usually a bit faster than filling with some predefined value):

```{python}
np.empty((4, 3))
```

Note that those values are arbitrary and might be different on your computer, so we have to make sure to populate the array later with the desired values.

Finally, `np.eye()` is a nice shortcut to create a square "identity" array (with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere):

```{python}
np.eye(5)
```

### Random numbers
The `numpy.random` module provides functions to generate (pseudo-)random numbers from a variety of distributions. This works as follows: first, we create a generator, which we can then use to draw random numbers from a specific probability distribution. In the following example, we use the default generator provided by `default_rng()`. We also set the random seed of this generator (`42` in this example, but the specific value does not matter), which means that we will get the exact same random numbers every time we run our code. This is important to facilitate reproducable results.

```{python}
from numpy.random import default_rng
rng = default_rng(42)
x1 = rng.standard_normal(10)
x2 = rng.uniform(size=(2, 2))
x3 = rng.integers(low=-3, high=99, size=(2, 5))
```

```{python}
x1
x2
x3
```

## Shape and reshape
Every array has a certain shape, which determines how its values are structured. The desired shape can be passed as an argument when creating an array, but it can also be changed later on. The `shape` attribute of an array returns the current shape as a tuple, listing the number of elements in every dimension (also called axis).

We already saw how we can create various arrays with different shapes using the `shape` argument:

```{python}
np.zeros(shape=(2, 3))
np.ones(shape=(3, 2))
np.full(shape=(2, 4), fill_value=2)
np.empty(shape=(2, 3))
```

Functions that create arrays with random numbers use the `size` argument to specify the desired shape (in the following examples we are reusing the `rng` generator created in the previous section).

```{python}
rng.standard_normal(size=(2, 5))
rng.uniform(size=(2, 2))
rng.integers(low=-3, high=99, size=(2, 5))
```

However, we can always change the current shape of an array to a new compatible shape. Here, compatible means that the total number of elements must stay the same, so we could reshape an array with 3 rows and 4 columns to 6 rows and 2 columns (the total number of elements remains 12).

There are three main ways to change the shape of an array:

1.  Assign a new shape to the `shape` attribute
2.  Use the `resize()` method
3.  Use the `reshape()` method

Let's take a look at each of these options in turn with the following `(3, 4)` example array:

```{python}
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])
x
x.shape
```

If we want to reshape this array to 4 rows and 3 columns, we can directly manipulate its shape:

```{python}
x.shape = (4, 3)
x
```

This modifies the shape of the array *in place*. Note that the way the array is stored in memory does not change, so this is a very fast operation.

Another way to change the shape is to call the `resize()` method with the new shape, which will also modify the array in place:

```{python}
x.resize((2, 6))
x
```

Finally, the `reshape()` method works just like `resize()`, but it creates a copy of the array with the new shape (so it does *not* modify it in place):

```{python}
x.reshape((3, 4))
x  # still (2, 6)
```

Of course you can always re-assign the new array to the previous name like this:

```{python}
x = x.reshape((3, 4))
x
```

We do not even have to specify the complete shape when using the `reshape()` or `resize()` methods; because the total number of elements must stay the same, we can set one dimension in the new shape tuple to `-1`, which means that its size will be calculated automatically:

```{python}
x.reshape((6, -1))  # -1 is inferred to mean 2 here
```

## Indexing and slicing
We can pull out one or more elements of an array using indexing and slicing. This works very similar to lists, at least for one-dimensional arrays. Let's start with a simple 1D array:

```{python}
x = np.arange(3, 19, 2, dtype=np.int64)
x
```

Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element is given by:

```{python}
x[0]
```

Similarly, we can index other positions of the array:

```{python}
x[2]
```

Negative indexes count from the end of the array, so the last element is:

```{python}
x[-1]
```

Slices pull out multiple elements with the `:` operator to indicate the desired range (and an optional step size). Note that the stop index is exclusive.

```{python}
x[1:5]  # start and stop
x[1:5:2]  # start, stop, and step
x[::-1]
```

When there is more than one dimension, we can provide indices or slices for each dimension (separated by commas):

```{python}
y = np.arange(12).reshape((3, 4))
y
y[1, 0]  # row 1, column 0
y[1:, 1:3]  # rows 1 through the last, columns 1 and 2
y[:, 3]  # column 3 (the fourth one)
y[1, :]  # row 1 (the second row)
```

If you do not provide indices or slices for some axes (or just use `:`), these are considered complete slices (so all elements in the missing dimensions are selected):

```{python}
y[0]  # first row, equivalent to y[0, :]
```

If you want to skip multiple axes, instead of providing a `:` for each axis, you can also use `...`. For example, let's create a five-dimensional array real quick:

```{python}
x = np.arange(720).reshape((3, 4, 5, 2, 6))  # five dimensions (axes)
```

The following slices can be abbreviated using `...` notation:

-   `x[1, 2, :, :, :]` is equal to `x[1, 2, ...]` and `x[1, 2]`
-   `x[:, 1, :, :, 4]` is equal to `x[:, 1, ..., 4]`
-   `x[:, :, :, :, 3]` is equal to `x[..., 3]`

### Fancy indexing
In contrast to lists, we can even use arrays (or lists) as indices inside the square brackets to pull out several individual elements. This is called fancy indexing.

```{python}
x = np.arange(10, 20, dtype=np.int64)
x
x[[1, 5, 1, 0]]  # elements 1, 5, 1, and 0
```

It is also possible to use boolean values in fancy indexing. This can be used to filter values in an array, because the result will contain only those values corresponding to `True` locations:

```{python}
x[[True, False, False, False, True, False, True, False, False, True]]
x > 15  # boolean array
x[x > 15]
```

We can even use indexing in an assignment. For example, let's assume we wanted to set all odd numbers to `-1`:

```{python}
x[x % 2 != 0] = -1  # % is the remainder operator
x
```

## Array operations
### Elementwise operations
In general, NumPy performs operations elementwise. If two arrays have the same shape, this is pretty straightforward:

```{python}
x = np.arange(1, 7).reshape((2, 3))
x
y = np.arange(7, 13).reshape((2, 3))
y
x + y
x - y
x * y
x / y
```

These operations are vectorized, which means that they are automatically applied to all array elements without us having to write a manual loop. Vectorized operations are extremely fast and efficient (they are basically as fast as in C or Fortran). Therefore, we should avoid loops over arrays whenever possible, because loops are really slow and inefficient in this context.

### Vector and matrix operations
Note that NumPy does not attach special meaning to 1D or 2D arrays. A 1D array is not interpreted as a vector, and neither is a 2D array interpreted as a matrix. However, it is of course possible to perform vector and matrix operations with special notation. Specifically, the dot product between two vectors can be computed with the `@` operator:

```{python}
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
a @ b
```

Similarly, the `@` operator computes matrix multiplication if the operands are 2D arrays:

```{python}
A = np.arange(6).reshape((2, 3))
B = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
A @ B
```

Note that if the shapes are not compatible with matrix multiplication (the number of columns of the first operand must equal the number of rows of the second operand), we will get an error.

In summary, we saw that if two arrays have the same shape, operations are performed elementwise. Things get a little more complicated when the two arrays have different shapes -- we will discuss this so-called broadcasting soon. But before that, there's even more we can do with just a single array using special methods.

### Array methods
There are many array methods that perform some kind of computation across *all* elements (regardless of the shape), such as calculating the total sum, minimum, maximum, or mean:

```{python}
x = np.arange(1, 13).reshape((3, 4))
x
x.sum()
x.mean()
```

However, we can also perform these operations along specific dimensions. For example, by computing the sum over axis 0 (the rows), we get the column sums:

```{python}
x.sum(axis=0)
```

Similarly, we can compute the row means if we perform the operation over the columns (axis 1):

```{python}
x.mean(axis=1)
```

Remember that the specified axis will disappear from the result! This also works for more than one axis:

```{python}
y = np.arange(60).reshape((4, 3, 5))  # four 3 x 5 arrays
y.mean(axis=(1, 2))  # compute the means of the four arrays
```

In this example, `y` has shape `(4, 3, 5)`. Because we compute the mean across axes `1` and `2` (remember that Python starts counting at zero), this leaves only axis `0`. Because axis `0` has four elements, we get four individual means.

### Universal functions
Other useful functions are directly available in the `numpy` namespace, for example `np.sin()`, `np.cos()`, `np.exp()`, `np.sqrt()`, and so on. They are vectorized (and therefore operate on all elements) and are referred to as *universal functions* (or short *ufuncs*).

```{python}
np.sqrt(x)
```


## Broadcasting
Even when two array shapes are different, calculations still work if certain conditions are met. The rules for this so-called *broadcasting* are:

1.  If two arrays have different shapes, the array with fewer dimensions will automatically get new dimensions with size 1 on the left until it matches the number of the larger array.
2.  Elements in dimensions with size 1 are automatically repeated to match the size of the largest array in that dimension.

If the shapes of the two arrays are the same after broadcasting, NumPy is able to compute the result. If the dimensions still do not match, the operation will result in an error ("operands could not be broadcast together").

Let's illustrate these rules with some examples:

```{python}
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # shape (3,) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3)
y = np.ones((2, 3), dtype=int)  # shape (2, 3)
x + y  # works
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # shape (3,) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3)
y = np.ones((2, 4), dtype=int)  # shape (2, 4)
x + y  # does not work because shapes (2, 3) and (2, 4) do not match
```
```
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3,) (2,4)
```

```{python}
x = np.arange(6).reshape((2, 3))  # shape (2, 3) -> (1, 2, 3) -> (3, 2, 3)
y = np.arange(18).reshape((3, 2, 3))  # shape (3, 2, 3)
x + y  # works
```

## Useful functions
This sections summarizes some useful functions that have not been mentioned already.

### Finding unique values
A common task in many data analysis pipelines is to determine the number of unique elements in an array. The `np.unique()` function does exactly that (and more):

```{python}
x = np.array([5, 7, 2, 5, 1, 3, 5, 5, 2, 1, 7, 7, 2, 2])
np.unique(x)
```

It is also possible to count the number of items for each unique value:

```{python}
np.unique(x, return_counts=True)
```

Used like this, the function returns a tuple, where the first element corresponds to the unique elements, and the second element contains their frequencies. In this example, we can see that `1` occurs `2` times, `2` occurs `4` times, and so on.

### Repeating an array
The `np.tile()` function creates a new array by repeating a given array a certain number of times:

```{python}
a = np.eye(2, dtype=int)
a
np.tile(a, 2)
np.tile(a, (2, 1))
np.tile(a, (2, 4))
```

### Sorting an array
The `sort()` method sorts an array in place:

```{python}
x = rng.integers(low=0, high=100, size=15)
x
x.sort()
x
```

### Sampling from an array
Given an array and a random generator, it is possible to create a random sample from the array (with or without replacement) using the `choice()` method of the random generator:

```{python}
x = np.array([0, 1])
rng.choice([0, 1], size=20)  # rng is defined in a previous example
rng.choice(np.arange(20), size=10, replace=False)
```

### Shuffling an array
Similarly, the `shuffle()` method shuffles a given array in place:

```{python}
x = np.arange(10)
rng.shuffle(x)
x
```
